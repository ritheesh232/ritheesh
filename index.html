    <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ritheesh Kumar, a dedicated and passionate individual, currently studying in Class 12 at Velammal Bodhi Campus. I am aspiring to crack the UPSC and become a top-ranking civil servant. I believe in the power of leadership, history, and learning.</p>
        <p>I know multiple languages: Tamil, English, Japanese, and Russian, which helps me connect with people from different cultures and understand the world better.</p>
        <p>I'm deeply interested in history, especially world history, as it shapes the present and future. My goal is to leave a mark in history, to lead, and to change the course of events, much like the great leaders before me.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes is by Napoleon Bonaparte: "The strong man is the one who is able to overcome the greatest of difficulties, not the one who is born with power." I strive to embody this spirit every day, facing challenges with determination and resilience.</p>
        <p>Another quote that inspires me is by Lenin: "Freedom in a capitalistic society is the same as in ancient Greek republics‚Äîfreedom only to slave owners." This reminds me of the importance of understanding the foundations of society to bring about meaningful change.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about chess and cricket, two activities that sharpen my mind and teach me the value of strategy and teamwork. My journey is focused on becoming not just a successful individual, but a catalyst for change.</p>
